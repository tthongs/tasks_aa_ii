# White Sauce Maggi (Bachelor Style)

A creamy and delicious Maggi recipe that's easy to make with simple ingredients.

## Ingredients

*   Maggi noodles: 1 pack
*   Milk: 1 cup
*   All-purpose flour (maida) or Wheat flour (atta): 1 tablespoon
*   Butter or Oil: 1 tablespoon
*   Garlic: 1-2 cloves, finely chopped (optional)
*   Onion: 1 small, finely chopped (optional)
*   Salt: to taste
*   Black pepper: to taste
*   Chilli flakes: (optional)
*   Maggi Tastemaker: 1 sachet

## Instructions

1.  **Cook the Maggi:**
    *   Boil the Maggi noodles in 1.5 cups of water until they are cooked.
    *   Do **not** add the Tastemaker at this stage.
    *   Drain the water and set the cooked noodles aside.

2.  **Prepare the White Sauce:**
    *   Heat the butter or oil in a pan or kadai over medium heat.
    *   If you're using garlic or onion, add them now and sauté for a minute until they turn fragrant and translucent.
    *   Add the flour (maida or atta) and roast it for about a minute on low heat, stirring continuously until it gives a slightly nutty aroma. Don't let it brown.
    *   Slowly pour in the milk while stirring constantly with a whisk or spoon to prevent any lumps from forming.
    *   Continue to stir and cook the sauce for 2-3 minutes until it starts to thicken.

3.  **Combine and Finish:**
    *   Once the sauce has thickened, add the Maggi Tastemaker, salt (be careful as the tastemaker is already salty), and black pepper. Mix well.
    *   Add the cooked Maggi noodles to the pan.
    *   Gently mix everything together until the noodles are evenly coated in the creamy white sauce.
    *   Sprinkle with chilli flakes for a little heat (optional).
    *   Serve hot and enjoy!
