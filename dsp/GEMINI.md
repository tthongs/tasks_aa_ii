# Directory Overview

This directory contains notes and resources for studying Digital Signal Processing (DSP). It serves as a central place to organize concepts and topics related to DSP.

# Key Files

*   `topics`: This file lists the main topics of study in DSP covered in this project. The topics range from the fundamentals of signal conversion (ADC, DAC) to advanced concepts like digital filters, modulation techniques, and signal analysis methods.

# Usage

This directory can be used to expand on the topics listed in the `topics` file. It is recommended to create a separate file for each topic to keep the notes organized. For example, you can create files like:

*   `adc_dac.md`
*   `fourier_transform.md`
*   `digital_filters.md`

You can then add detailed notes, diagrams, and code snippets to each file.
